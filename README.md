Thank you for playing APOCALYPSE!

Before you begin to play, or try to run the provided .py file,
you must download and extract the contents of the APOCALYPSE
folder onto your computer. 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>To do this, simply download and put the APOCALYPSE folder into
>the "Pictures" folder of your computer. After this, the file path of this
>folder will be ---------> C:\Users\?\Pictures\APOCALYPSE
>
>After this process is completed, go into the APOCALYPSE.py
>file in Eclipse/other IDE, and CTRL+F to find and replace
>the file path name "trist" with your Windows user.

From here, you may run the game in Eclipse/other IDE.
